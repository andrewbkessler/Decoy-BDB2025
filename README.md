DECOY: A Predictive Model

This is my 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl submission. I attempted to create an XGBoost model to predict whether players in motion at the snap are contributing to the play or attempting to lure the defense away from the play direction.

How to Run:
1. You will need to download the data folder (including "decoy_guide.csv"). Place all data from the Big Data Bowl competition into this folder.
2. Run the "01_data_prep.R" script
3. Run the "02_model.R" script
4. Run the "03_analysis.R" script
5. Run the "04_animations.R" script
